The promise is simple: packaged reusable code that makes powerful widgets like grids, toolbars, menus, smart input controls, panels, media players, charts, graphs, trees, image viewers, and so on, easy to integrate into applications.\r\n\r\nOn the web, frameworks such as ASP.NET, JSF, Tapestry, Wicket, GWT, and Vaadin take advantage of component architectures, and there is no shortage of JavaScript/HTML5 widget libraries such as YUI, KendoUI, jQuery UI, Bootstrap, ExtJS, and so on. Each of these frameworks allows developers to build their own custom components, but those components won’t work outside of the framework. Wouldn’t it be nice if there were a standard way to build a UI component that runs in a browser? A component model that is part of the open web?\r\n\r\nFinally, there is: Web Components, an emerging standard from the Web Applications Working Group (WAWG). Web Components consists of five different standards: Templates, Decorators,\r\nCustom Elements, Shadow DOM, and Imports. Together, these standards allow you to build custom widgets with HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS that can be used just like native HTML elements.\r\n\r\nSince the standards are not fully supported in all browsers, you need a library to support them in non-compliant browsers. Google’s Polymer does just this, and more.\r\n\r\nCome to this workshop to learn about these exciting new technologies hands-on.","presentationLink":null,"speakers":[{"id":3991,"createdDate":1415554878993,"updatedDate":1420264373146,"version":5,"bio":"Kito D.

It was simply referred to as JSR 107, one of the least things to change in the upcoming future. But those pals were way ahead of their time and nothing really happend. So time passed by and by and by and over the years it was buried in the deep catacombs of the JCP. Eventually, in 2011, two brave knights took on the fight and worked themselves through all the pathlessness, to finalize it in 2014. Lads you know what I'm talking about, they called it the \"Java Caching API\" or in short \"JCache\". Yes you heard me, a Java standard for Caching!\r\n\r\nA software system cannot possibly imagined without Caching today and it was time for a standard. No matter if you want to cache database queries, generated HTML or results of long running calculations, new systems have to reach a critical mass to be successful.

This session is about finally understanding Rx and removing all the myth surrounding it.","presentationLink":"","speakers":[{"id":4483,"createdDate":1418753424502,"updatedDate":1418754400452,"version":2,"bio":"Developer and creator of many things OSS, his passions includes Web Development and Software Architecture.

Some of the new features involved include building modular elements inside of HTML Templates, support to write your own unique Custom Elements with custom named tags (eg. <fancy-button></fancy-button> could be functioning html), the Shadow DOM which protects styles from bleeding over, and Model Driven Views (front end to back end data binding). Google's Platform.js is also being used by Mozilla X-Tags. \r\n\r\n It is important to note that Polymer is forward facing only and does not attempt to conform to any sort of backwards compatibility; only the last two versions of any given browser are supported and there is no intention to appeal to previous standards. Polymer is not a programming language, it's just an opinionated library. The core polymer team are also key contributors to W3C's evolving standards for web components. Work being done now is for tomorrow's standard, so we can get a fresh perspective on how the web should work instead of simply conforming to legacy approaches.\r\n\r\nThe talk will include basic instructions for getting started with Polymer using NPM and Bower. We will discuss the role of web components in future standards. There will be a general outline of how Polymer and it's dependencies fits into the stack and what job each part of the stack preforms. \r\n\r\nWe will go over how to make custom elements so you can get started actually having fun with Polymer.","presentationLink":"","speakers":[{"id":4820,"createdDate":1420761392353,"updatedDate":1421104247389,"version":1,"bio":"Jonathan Popham's philosophy is to make stuff just for fun.

This phenomenon of picking and sticking with a framework for all the wrong reasons affects everything we do, from the estimates we give, to the people we hire, and the companies we want to work for.

It tends to be most successful in small companies, with small teams that can work completely independently of others. It tends to fail when more teams are involved, when there are dependencies between them. Even though we're \"doing Scrum\", it still just doesn't yield the promised benefits. When agile fails it can be disappointing and costly. People get blamed, agile gets blamed, the training gets blamed, and the organizational culture gets blamed. Yet companies keep trying. Many companies make multiple attempts to transition to agile because they've bought in to the underlying principles of agile and see it as a solution to their problem hitting dates, their long time to market, their slow return on investment, and their quality problems.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll examine 8 causes for Agile's failure in large enterprises, and why starting a transformation with culture or even practices isn't the solution. We'll examine why the ultimate solution begins with putting in place the certain organizational structures and planning a journey through predictability on our way to adaptability. Specifically, to begin we need a thoughtful mix of product or feature teams and component or service teams, as cross functional as practicable in each instance; agile structures above the team; and appropriate agile governance at the portfolio and program management layers. This creates an environment in which agile can begin to stick, can begin to deliver value, and creates a platform from which we can move on to increased agility.","presentationLink":"","speakers":[{"id":1392,"createdDate":null,"updatedDate":1419634129306,"version":3,"bio":"Andrew Fuqua began developing software professionally in the mid '80s using an iterative and incremental approach.

If you truly want to automate the execution of a broad test suite—embracing unit, component, integration, functional, performance, and security testing—during continuous integration, you need to ensure that your test suite is up to the task. How do you achieve this? This session will provide tips on ensuring that your tests are up to the task:\r\n•\tLogically-componentized: Tests need to be logically-componentized so you can assess the impact at change time. When tests fail and they're logically correlated to components, it is much easier to establish priority and associate tasks to the correct resource.\r\n•\tIncremental: Tests can be built upon each other, without impacting the integrity of the original or new test case.\r\n•\tRepeatable: Tests can be executed over and over again with each incremental build, integration, or release process.\r\n•\tDeterministic and meaningful:  Tests must be clean and deterministic. Pass and fail have unambiguous meanings.  Each test should do exactly what you want it to do—no more and no less.  Tests should fail only when an actual problem you care about has been detected. Moreover, the failure should be obvious and clearly communicate what went wrong.\r\n•\tMaintainable within a process: A test that's out of sync with the code will either generate incorrect failures (false positives) or overlook real problems (false negatives).  An automated process for evolving test artifacts is just as important as the construction of new tests.  \r\n•\tPrescriptive workflow based on results: When a test does fail, it should trigger a process-driven workflow that lets team members know what's expected and how to proceed. This typically includes a prioritized task list.\r\n\r\n","presentationLink":"","speakers":[{"id":4906,"createdDate":1425680548691,"updatedDate":1425680807391,"version":1,"bio":"Andrey Madan is a software testing professional focusing on automated tools and methodologies.

This workshop concentrates on one of the most important things UX professionals do: help businesses focus on the customer. \r\n\r\nIn this workshop you will roll up your sleeves and actually participate in some UX research activities. You'll learn how even a little bit of customer interaction can lead to huge insights... and then you'll learn how to interpret those insights and incorporate them back into your Agile project. \r\n\r\nInformation for Review Team: \r\nIn the first activity, the participants will play the role of the customer. I guide them through a couple of exercises to create an outline of what customers need and want from a product. I’ll use an accessible example, like a web application for paying a bill online. \r\n\r\n1. In four or five areas around the room, put a piece of poster paper on the wall. \r\n2. Split the participants into groups.\r\n3. Have each group fill in boxes on the paper to describe the attributes of a particular kind of user but focus on the tasks that user needs or wants to accomplish (like a brand new user who needs to pay a late bill). This includes describing what helps or impedes them from doing their task. It also includes describing the user in useful ways (this person is typically early 20’s, in a hurry, has kids, etc.)\r\n4. Rotate the groups to add/subtract/move things from the previous groups list.\r\nOnce this is complete, I’ll demonstrate how this information can be used to create a “quick and dirty” persona, as well as describe how additional research can be combined with this activity to create a more formal persona.\r\n\r\nFinally, I’ll lead the participants through an activity where they play the role of the business trying to prioritize stories. I’ll show them how they can use the personas to help guide them and how to help avoid common the trap of thinking that just because they know the business intimately they automatically know what the customer would need or want. \r\n\r\nPrerequisite Knowledge: \r\nGeneral Agile knowledge, particularly SCRUM framework, is assumed.","presentationLink":"","speakers":[{"id":4465,"createdDate":1418681107037,"updatedDate":1418681590610,"version":1,"bio":"Erika Burrows, PMP, PMI-ACP has a diverse professional background that includes being a 9-1-1 operator, a supervisor in an automotive factory, an enumerator for the U.S. Census Bureau, and a college English teacher.

Split the participants into groups.\r\n3. Have each group fill in boxes on the paper to describe the attributes of a particular kind of user but focus on the tasks that user needs or wants to accomplish (like a brand new user who needs to pay a late bill). This includes describing what helps or impedes them from doing their task. It also includes describing the user in useful ways (this person is typically early 20’s, in a hurry, has kids, etc.)\r\n4. Rotate the groups to add/subtract/move things from the previous groups list.\r\nOnce this is complete, I’ll demonstrate how this information can be used to create a “quick and dirty” persona, as well as describe how additional research can be combined with this activity to create a more formal persona.\r\n\r\nFinally, I’ll lead the participants through an activity where they play the role of the business trying to prioritize stories. I’ll show them how they can use the personas to help guide them and how to help avoid common the trap of thinking that just because they know the business intimately they automatically know what the customer would need or want. \r\n\r\nPrerequisite Knowledge: \r\nGeneral Agile knowledge, particularly SCRUM framework, is assumed.","presentationLink":"","speakers":[{"id":4465,"createdDate":1418681107037,"updatedDate":1418681590610,"version":1,"bio":"Erika Burrows, PMP, PMI-ACP has a diverse professional background that includes being a 9-1-1 operator, a supervisor in an automotive factory, an enumerator for the U.S. Census Bureau, and a college English teacher.

It was simply referred to as JSR 107, one of the least things to change in the upcoming future. But those pals were way ahead of their time and nothing really happend. So time passed by and by and by and over the years it was buried in the deep catacombs of the JCP. Eventually, in 2011, two brave knights took on the fight and worked themselves through all the pathlessness, to finalize it in 2014. Lads you know what I'm talking about, they called it the \"Java Caching API\" or in short \"JCache\". Yes you heard me, a Java standard for Caching!\r\n\r\nA software system cannot possibly imagined without Caching today and it was time for a standard. No matter if you want to cache database queries, generated HTML or results of long running calculations, new systems have to reach a critical mass to be successful.

Think of encapsulation or OOP. Google's approach is Polymer, a library which provides a \"sugaring layer\" of features. Polymer is built on top of platform.js, which extends the functionality of your browser to include next-gen features required to run web components. Some of the new features involved include building modular elements inside of HTML Templates, support to write your own unique Custom Elements with custom named tags (eg. <fancy-button></fancy-button> could be functioning html), the Shadow DOM which protects styles from bleeding over, and Model Driven Views (front end to back end data binding). Google's Platform.js is also being used by Mozilla X-Tags. \r\n\r\n It is important to note that Polymer is forward facing only and does not attempt to conform to any sort of backwards compatibility; only the last two versions of any given browser are supported and there is no intention to appeal to previous standards. Polymer is not a programming language, it's just an opinionated library. The core polymer team are also key contributors to W3C's evolving standards for web components. Work being done now is for tomorrow's standard, so we can get a fresh perspective on how the web should work instead of simply conforming to legacy approaches.\r\n\r\nThe talk will include basic instructions for getting started with Polymer using NPM and Bower.

But in our practice today, what is the very first thing that we hide when screen size gets tight?\r\n\r\nThe navigation.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we are starting to see that users actually downright ignore the nav, even when it’s visible in all of its desktop,docked glory. Users go straight for the big shiny objects - the content on the page.\r\n \r\nSo, if we hamburgered our navigation on mobile, and people ignore it on desktop, how do we get people to flow through our site? Well, the content must become the navigation. This is where Object Oriented UX comes in.  OOUX helps create an efficient, elegant modular system.

If you truly want to automate the execution of a broad test suite—embracing unit, component, integration, functional, performance, and security testing—during continuous integration, you need to ensure that your test suite is up to the task. How do you achieve this? This session will provide tips on ensuring that your tests are up to the task:\r\n•\tLogically-componentized: Tests need to be logically-componentized so you can assess the impact at change time. When tests fail and they're logically correlated to components, it is much easier to establish priority and associate tasks to the correct resource.\r\n•\tIncremental: Tests can be built upon each other, without impacting the integrity of the original or new test case.\r\n•\tRepeatable: Tests can be executed over and over again with each incremental build, integration, or release process.\r\n•\tDeterministic and meaningful:  Tests must be clean and deterministic. Pass and fail have unambiguous meanings.  Each test should do exactly what you want it to do—no more and no less.  Tests should fail only when an actual problem you care about has been detected. Moreover, the failure should be obvious and clearly communicate what went wrong.\r\n•\tMaintainable within a process: A test that's out of sync with the code will either generate incorrect failures (false positives) or overlook real problems (false negatives).  An automated process for evolving test artifacts is just as important as the construction of new tests.  \r\n•\tPrescriptive workflow based on results: When a test does fail, it should trigger a process-driven workflow that lets team members know what's expected and how to proceed. This typically includes a prioritized task list.\r\n\r\n","presentationLink":"","speakers":[{"id":4906,"createdDate":1425680548691,"updatedDate":1425680807391,"version":1,"bio":"Andrey Madan is a software testing professional focusing on automated tools and methodologies.

Web Components consists of five different standards: Templates, Decorators,\r\nCustom Elements, Shadow DOM, and Imports. Together, these standards allow you to build custom widgets with HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS that can be used just like native HTML elements.\r\n\r\nSince the standards are not fully supported in all browsers, you need a library to support them in non-compliant browsers. Google’s Polymer does just this, and more.\r\n\r\nCome to this workshop to learn about these exciting new technologies hands-on.","presentationLink":null,"speakers":[{"id":3991,"createdDate":1415554878993,"updatedDate":1420264373146,"version":5,"bio":"Kito D.

This phenomenon of picking and sticking with a framework for all the wrong reasons affects everything we do, from the estimates we give, to the people we hire, and the companies we want to work for.  Attempts to mitigate the risk of poor framework choices are often thwarted by the ability of a single developer to introduce a questionable framework that then gets adopted by their peers.

It tends to be most successful in small companies, with small teams that can work completely independently of others. It tends to fail when more teams are involved, when there are dependencies between them. Even though we're \"doing Scrum\", it still just doesn't yield the promised benefits. When agile fails it can be disappointing and costly. People get blamed, agile gets blamed, the training gets blamed, and the organizational culture gets blamed. Yet companies keep trying. Many companies make multiple attempts to transition to agile because they've bought in to the underlying principles of agile and see it as a solution to their problem hitting dates, their long time to market, their slow return on investment, and their quality problems.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll examine 8 causes for Agile's failure in large enterprises, and why starting a transformation with culture or even practices isn't the solution. We'll examine why the ultimate solution begins with putting in place the certain organizational structures and planning a journey through predictability on our way to adaptability. Specifically, to begin we need a thoughtful mix of product or feature teams and component or service teams, as cross functional as practicable in each instance; agile structures above the team; and appropriate agile governance at the portfolio and program management layers. This creates an environment in which agile can begin to stick, can begin to deliver value, and creates a platform from which we can move on to increased agility.","presentationLink":"","speakers":[{"id":1392,"createdDate":null,"updatedDate":1419634129306,"version":3,"bio":"Andrew Fuqua began developing software professionally in the mid '80s using an iterative and incremental approach.

When I'm not coding I enjoy tennis, a good craft beer, or hanging out with my wonderful wife and two kids.","firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Morrow","twitterId":"_ChrisMorrow","googlePlusId":"+ChrisMorrow181","linkedInId":"chrisjmorrow","lanyrdId":"chrisjmorrow","githubId":"cmorrow"},{"id":4838,"createdDate":1421173341984,"updatedDate":1421187825671,"version":1,"bio":"Yoav is the CTO of JFrog, the Artifactory Binary Repository creators, JavaOne 2011 and 2013 Duke Choice Awards winner; Yoav laid the foundation to JFrog's flagship product in 2006 when he founded Artifactory as an open source project.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 he co-founded JFrog where he leads the future of products like Artifactory and, more recently, Bintray.\r\nPrior to starting up JFrog, Yoav was a software architect and consultant in the field of configuration management and server-side JVM applications.
