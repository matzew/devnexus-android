This model includes facts such as \"we have identified four customer profiles, each with different browsing and purchasing patterns\" or \"the analytics query for the management report must run every Wednesday afternoon.\"  Models are versioned and kept in a database.\r\n\r\n#### Activity streams\r\n\r\nThe statistical models are used to create activity streams. Each agent in the system represents a human user or external process interacting with the system, and has its own timestamped stream of interactions. With a large number of agents, simulations can produce the highly concurrent activity expected in a large production system.\r\n\r\n#### Distributed execution\r\n\r\nAgents are scaled across as many machines as are necessary to both handle the simulation load, and give access to the system under test.  The simulator coordinates time, playing through the activity streams for all the agents.\r\n\r\n#### Capture results\r\n\r\nEvery step of the simulation process, including modeling, activity stream generation, execution, and the code itself, is captured and stored in a database for further analysis. You will typically also capture whatever logs and metrics your system produces.\r\n\r\n#### Validation\r\n\r\nSince all phases of a simulation are kept in a database, validation can be performed at any time. This differs markedly from many approaches to testing, which require in-the-moment validation against the live system.\r\n\r\n#### Separation of concerns\r\n\r\nThe separation of concerns above, and the use of a versioned, time-aware database, gives simulation great power. Imagine that you get a bug report from the field, and you realize that the bug corresponds to a corner case that you failed to consider. With a simulation-based approach, you can write a new validation for the corner case, and run that validation against your past simulation results, without ever running your actual system.\r\n\r\nThis talk will introduce simulation testing, walking through a complete example using an open-source simulation library.\r\n","presentationLink":"https://github.com/stuarthalloway/presentations/blob/master/DevNexus2013/Concurrency.pdf?raw=true","speakers":[{"createdDate":null,"version":1,"id":1391,"updatedDate":null,"bio":"[@stuarthalloway](http://twitter.com/stuarthalloway) is a founder and CTO of [Relevance](http://thinkrelevance.com).

Yet there are still untapped possibilities for the cloud, including one overlooked area where the cloud can shine: testing. At Nexidia, we develop a large scale phonetic analytics framework, performing computational intensive operations across a cluster of servers, utilizing a MapReduce like strategy. This cluster can be as small as a single node, or as large as the needs demand. Testing large scale deployments in house has proven a real challenge; even with an unlimited budget, we cannot possibly anticipate all our future hardware requirements. The cloud has proven to be an excellent answer to this problem. With AWS (Amazon Web Services), we have developed a full automated testing harness in the cloud. This tool utilizes several of the AWS offerings:\r\n\r\n* EC2 provides the server instances to create deployments of (almost) any cluster size and server \r\ninstance type. \r\n* Custom AMI images, from which the instances are spawned, contain the bootstrap app \r\nresponsible for application installation and configuration upon instance initialization. \r\n* S3 storage hosts the test data. \r\n* Notifications are passed from and to the cluster via SQS. \r\n* VPC offers a private cloud, thus securing the cluster deployment.\r\n\r\nCosts are kept in check, as the server instances are terminated as soon as the test case is complete. Testing in the cloud allows us to explore corner cases, find bottlenecks in the application framework and helps us form recommendations and best practices for our clients. Along the way, we have learnt many lessons about the cloud, AWS, and testing in general.

This model includes facts such as \"we have identified four customer profiles, each with different browsing and purchasing patterns\" or \"the analytics query for the management report must run every Wednesday afternoon.\"  Models are versioned and kept in a database.\r\n\r\n#### Activity streams\r\n\r\nThe statistical models are used to create activity streams. Each agent in the system represents a human user or external process interacting with the system, and has its own timestamped stream of interactions. With a large number of agents, simulations can produce the highly concurrent activity expected in a large production system.\r\n\r\n#### Distributed execution\r\n\r\nAgents are scaled across as many machines as are necessary to both handle the simulation load, and give access to the system under test.  The simulator coordinates time, playing through the activity streams for all the agents.\r\n\r\n#### Capture results\r\n\r\nEvery step of the simulation process, including modeling, activity stream generation, execution, and the code itself, is captured and stored in a database for further analysis. You will typically also capture whatever logs and metrics your system produces.\r\n\r\n#### Validation\r\n\r\nSince all phases of a simulation are kept in a database, validation can be performed at any time. This differs markedly from many approaches to testing, which require in-the-moment validation against the live system.\r\n\r\n#### Separation of concerns\r\n\r\nThe separation of concerns above, and the use of a versioned, time-aware database, gives simulation great power. Imagine that you get a bug report from the field, and you realize that the bug corresponds to a corner case that you failed to consider. With a simulation-based approach, you can write a new validation for the corner case, and run that validation against your past simulation results, without ever running your actual system.\r\n\r\nThis talk will introduce simulation testing, walking through a complete example using an open-source simulation library.\r\n","presentationLink":"https://github.com/stuarthalloway/presentations/blob/master/DevNexus2013/Concurrency.pdf?raw=true","speakers":[{"createdDate":null,"version":1,"id":1391,"updatedDate":null,"bio":"[@stuarthalloway](http://twitter.com/stuarthalloway) is a founder and CTO of [Relevance](http://thinkrelevance.com).

Yet there are still untapped possibilities for the cloud, including one overlooked area where the cloud can shine: testing. At Nexidia, we develop a large scale phonetic analytics framework, performing computational intensive operations across a cluster of servers, utilizing a MapReduce like strategy. This cluster can be as small as a single node, or as large as the needs demand. Testing large scale deployments in house has proven a real challenge; even with an unlimited budget, we cannot possibly anticipate all our future hardware requirements. The cloud has proven to be an excellent answer to this problem. With AWS (Amazon Web Services), we have developed a full automated testing harness in the cloud. This tool utilizes several of the AWS offerings:\r\n\r\n* EC2 provides the server instances to create deployments of (almost) any cluster size and server \r\ninstance type. \r\n* Custom AMI images, from which the instances are spawned, contain the bootstrap app \r\nresponsible for application installation and configuration upon instance initialization. \r\n* S3 storage hosts the test data. \r\n* Notifications are passed from and to the cluster via SQS. \r\n* VPC offers a private cloud, thus securing the cluster deployment.\r\n\r\nCosts are kept in check, as the server instances are terminated as soon as the test case is complete. Testing in the cloud allows us to explore corner cases, find bottlenecks in the application framework and helps us form recommendations and best practices for our clients. Along the way, we have learnt many lessons about the cloud, AWS, and testing in general.
